## Build a DIY screen out of recycled laptop parts

For a while now i have been meaning to do a DIY project in my spare time,

The inspiration comes from different challenges i face whether am working or doing something else,
For instance I hate working for long hours seating in a chair so the solution will be to get a new standing table,
this is enough fuel to get me started with the research, design etc.
